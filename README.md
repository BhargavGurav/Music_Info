<h1>Analysis of a music information</h1>
<hr>
<p>This repository contain one jupyter notebook which has a source code, in which analysis of the data is done And different questions which were asked in ass5 file are solved.
The data is of music. First we were given a large csv file but after clearing I saved data in cleaned file. It has various information like music_id, name, danceablility score of a song,
duration of music, genre of music, artist who made the song. Using this information the questions are tried to solve by me. </p>
<p>I have also tried to visualize things so that it will be helpful to see the results in less time. Here is the link :
